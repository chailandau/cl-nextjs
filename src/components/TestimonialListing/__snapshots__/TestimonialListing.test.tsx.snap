              Chai's transition from design to frontend development shines in her work, whether it be seamless frontend experiences or accessible, organized, and considered code. I learned a lot from her; she had interests in frontend development tools that I wasn’t familiar with, and she was able to dive into a subject and share those knowledge and skills extremely well. Not only is she technically skilled, but she’s incredibly communicative, a team player, a teacher, and a wonderful colleague!

              Working with Chai was a treat! She's my favorite kind of engineer - one who can take the most complex ideas and simplify them for those of us who need the extra help understanding. She always took the time to make sure I was grasping these concepts for myself but also that I was relaying accurate information to our clients.

She's a true master of her craft with an accessibility-first approach to everything she does. Any engineering team would be fortunate to have her!

              Chai was a valuable resource and a helpful mentor for my internship at Clique Studios. Whether it was walking me through implementing animations into my sites or teaching me how to best use templating through handlebars.js, Chai was always able to make complex concepts seem approachable and took the time to help give me what I needed to succeed.

              Chai was always available if I needed help, very accommodating and answered any questions I had when working on projects. She also guided me when working with Wordpress websites as well as CSS/HTML. This exposure to using code and working on the backend of Wordpress sites, coupled with Chai’s patience and eagerness to share her professional knowledge, provided me with useful knowledge for my current job. It was a pleasure learning and working with Chai.

              Chai was a pleasure to work with! Her work was always high-caliber design and required very little feedback from start to finish.

She has great critical thinking skills and was very helpful in anticipating what might be required after initial solutions. Her work was thorough and she quickly understood the level of delivery we expected.
