# Chai Landau - Portfolio Frontend

This is the frontend for my portfolio. It is a headless build using Next.js coupled with a PayloadCMS backend.

## Tech stack

-   <strong>[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)</strong> - Using ISR allows incremental updates without the whole site having to be rebuilt (while staying static for SEO).
-   <strong>[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</strong> - Adds type safeties and reduces potential errors further down the road
-   <strong>[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)</strong> - Acts as documentation and serves as a building block for snapshot and visual regression tests
-   <strong>[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)</strong> - Comprehensive testing library to ensure code is doing what it is supposed to
    -   Uses <strong>[jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe)</strong> as an additional A11y safety net (on top of extensive manual testing)
-   <strong>[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)</strong> Adds APIs on top of DOM Testing Library for easier React component testing
-   <strong>[Loki](https://loki.js.org/)</strong> - Generates screenshots of Storybook stories to use with reg-cli
-   <strong>[reg-cli](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-cli)</strong> - Generates report from screenshots generated by Loki to easily scan for visual regression.
-   <strong>[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)</strong> - Powerful motion library for React animations
